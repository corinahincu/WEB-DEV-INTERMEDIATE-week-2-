    Shuffle an array
importance: 3
Write the function shuffle(array) that shuffles (randomly reorders) elements of the array.

Multiple runs of shuffle may lead to different orders of elements. For instance:

let arr = [1, 2, 3];

shuffle(arr);
// arr = [3, 2, 1]

shuffle(arr);
// arr = [2, 1, 3]

shuffle(arr);
// arr = [3, 1, 2]
// ...
All element orders should have an equal probability. For instance, [1,2,3] can be reordered as [1,2,3] or [1,3,2] or [3,1,2] etc, with equal probability of each case.
